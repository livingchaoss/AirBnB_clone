## Description

*This team project is part of the alx-school Full-Stack Software Engineer program.*
*It's the first step toward building a first full web application: an AirBnB clone.*
*This first step consists of a custom command-line interface for data management, and the base classes for the storage of this data.*

## Usage

*The console works both in interactive mode and non-interactive mode, much like a unix shell.*
*It prints a prompt **(hbnb)** and waits for the user for input.*

Command | Example
------- | -------
Run the console | ```./console.py```
Quit the console | ```(hbnb) quit```
Display the help for a command | ```(hbnb) help <command>```
Create an object (prints its id) | ```(hbnb) create <class>```
Show an object | ```(hbnb) show <class> <id>``` or ```(hbnb) <class>.show(<id>)```
Destroy an object | ```(hbnb)
